# Code excerpts

Many site pages contain code excerpts, and these excerpts are kept in sync with
their originating [examples][] source file by use of the tools mentioned in this
page.

# How do I ...

This page answers the most common "how-to" questions related to code excerpts.

## How do I associate a code block with its source?

To associate a markdown code block with (a region of) a source file, use a
`<?code-excerpt?>` [processing instruction][] (or two). Here is an example taken
from [src/docs/development/ui/interactive.md][] (flutter/website):

    <?code-excerpt "layout/lakes/interactive/lib/main.dart (FavoriteWidget)"?>
    ```dart
    class FavoriteWidget extends StatefulWidget {
      @override
      _FavoriteWidgetState createState() => _FavoriteWidgetState();
    }
    ```

The excerpted code comes from the region named `FavoriteWidget` in the file
[layout/lakes/interactive/lib/main.dart][]. Regions are marked using the
`#docregion` syntax. For example:

```dart
...
// #docregion FavoriteWidget
class FavoriteWidget extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _FavoriteWidgetState createState() => _FavoriteWidgetState();
}
// #enddocregion FavoriteWidget
...
```

## What's the syntax for instructions and docregions?

For the full instruction syntax, see [\<?code-excerpt?> syntax][], from the
[code_excerpt_updater][] tool README. For information about `docregion`s see the
[code_excerpter][] tool README.

The tools have several useful features (not covered here), to help make your
life easier. For example, if all of the files in your page come from a single
folder, which can often be the case, then you can set the path base once, and
then use relative file paths in subsequent instructions, like this:

    <?code-excerpt path-base="layout/lakes/interactive"?>
    ...
    <?code-excerpt "lib/main.dart (FavoriteWidget)"?>
    ```dart
    // Some code
    ```

## How do I know if the code excerpts are fresh / synced?

Use the `./tool/refresh-code-excerpts.sh` script to ensure that in-page code
excerpts are fresh relative to the source files that they are extracted from.

The refresh script uses the following tools under the hood:

 1. [code_excerpter][] scans all source files and creates code excerpt files.
 2. [code_excerpt_updater][] scans the site pages, and refreshes code excerpts
    using the generated excerpt files.

## How do I edit an existing code excerpt?

You're working on a site page and you've found a code excerpt that needs to be
updated? Trace the excerpt back to its origin and make the changes in the
originating source. Then run the code-excerpt [refresh script](#refresh).

## How do I add a new excerpt to an existing example file

 1. Locate the source file.
 1. Identify the code region in that file.
 1. Choose a region name.
 1. Add `#docregion <region-name>` `#enddocregion <region-name>` tags.

## Can I excerpt an entire source file?

To excerpt an entire source file simply omit the region name from the processing
instruction.

> **Note:** When you omit the region name, it defaults to `''`, the empty region name.

> **Pro tip:** By default, the empty region name (`''`) corresponds to the
> entire file, but you can change that by using explicit `docregion` tags with
> `''` as a region name argument.

## How do I write a test for my code excerpt?

**Related:** [Should I write a test?][].

As is customary, test files live under `examples/my_example_project/test`.

If your code excerpt is small, embedded your code excerpt (bracketed by
`docregion` tags) directly in the test like this [hello-world example][]:

```dart
  test('hello world', () {
    // #docregion hello-world
    void main() {
      print('Hello, World!');
    }

    // #enddocregion hello-world
    expect(main, prints('Hello, World!\n'));
  });
```

If you are testing lots of code used, for example, as part of a tutorial, then
follow the recommended Dart practice of placing project code (with `docregion`
tags) under `lib`, and tests under `test`.


## Some code excerpts contain `[!...!]`, what's that?

Code enclosed in the special syntax `[!...!]` will be highlighted.

For example, the code

```
int [!foo!] = 1;
```

will display as

> <code>int <mark>foo</mark> = 1;</code>

**Legacy:** Markers like `[[highlight]]...[[/highlight]]` and
`[[strike]]...[[/strike]]` (and more) are still supported in some repos.

## How can I highlight part of a code excerpt

Since code excerpts are synced, you can't embed the highlight markers by hand.
Instead use the `replace` argument, for example:

    <?code-excerpt "bar/foo.dart" replace="/foo/[!$&!]/g"?>
    ```
    int [!foo!] = 1;
    ```

> **Note:** `$&` is the [regular expression][] syntax corresponding to the fully
> string that was matched. Groups and the group match syntax, such as `$1`,
> `$2`, etc. are also supported.

For more information about the `replace` argument syntax see
[code_excerpt_updater][].

# Advanced features

## Code diffs

To make use of code diffs in a given page, add the following to the page's front matter (or archive the equivalent setting using `_config.yml` file defaults):

```yaml
diff2html: true
```

A `<?code-excerpt?>` instruction will produce a code diff when two files are named using either of the following methods:

- Use the `diff-with` argument: `diff-with="path/to/second/file.ext"`.
- Use the bash brace syntax in the instruction's first unnamed argument:
  `path/to/{first,second}/file.ext`.

## Site-global and file-scope code excerpt transformations

The [code_excerpt_updater][] tool can apply site-global, file-scope and
code-excerpt specific `replace` transformations.

Site-global transformations are applied to all code excerpts. See
`./tool/refresh-code-excerpts.sh` for an annotated list of replace expressions passed
along with the `--replace` command line argument of the `code_excerpt_updater` command.

File-scope replace instructions can be placed anywhere in a doc page. Most often
the appear at the beginning of the page. Here is an example from
[src/_guides/language/effective-dart/design.md][]:

```html
<?code-excerpt replace="/([A-Z]\w*)\d\b/$1/g"?>
```

This particular transformation strips the trailing version number off of class names. For
example `String0` becomes `String`, and `Point1`, `Point2`, etc. all become `Point`. This
allows the originating source file to contain multiple versions of the same class.
